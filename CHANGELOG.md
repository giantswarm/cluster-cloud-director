## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Restructure nodepools and nodeclasses for GitOps.
- Allow core-component configuration via `kubeadm --patches`.
- Configure API priority and fairness flags based on node resources.
- Import the `cluster-shared` chart to apply additional `coredns` resources in a Workload Cluster via `ClusterResourceSets`
- Adapt control-plane configuration by comparing CAPO.
- Expose etcd metrics for prometheus.
- ⚠️ **Breaking:** Configure encryption at REST. This requires `{{ include "resource.default.name" $ }}-encryption-provider-config` secret with `encyrption` key to be present in the cluster (can be provisioned with [encryption-provider-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/encryption-provider-operator)).
- Adapt kube-proxy configuration for monitoring.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-11-15

### Added

- Use `cluster-apps-operator` generated `containerd` proxy configuration, if `proxy` is enabled
- It's possible to define an alternative `containerd` proxy configuration via `values.proxy.secretName`. Primarily used for bootstrapping new management clusters.

## [0.2.4] - 2022-10-25

### Changed

- Make proxy enabled/disabled explicit to match useability of cluster-aws chart.

## [0.2.2] - 2022-08-18

### CHANGED

- Removed cluster name from values file in favour of the chart's name.

### Added
